This project uses [Deleaker](https://www.deleaker.com/) to find memory leaks and more.

Dune II - The Maker
===================
A.k.a. D2TM. Is a [Dune 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_II) remake.

## Compiling
I work with CLion which uses CMake.

Hence the `CMakeList.txt` file in the root of this project.

I also use MinGW32.

The required libraries (ALFont, ALMP3, fblend, etc) are in the [lib folder](https://github.com/stefanhendriks/Dune-II---The-Maker/tree/master/lib/mingw).

Do not forget to also point to the [dependency includes dir](https://github.com/stefanhendriks/Dune-II---The-Maker/tree/master/dependencies/mingw32/include), or copy those over to your MinGW folder.

## Project status
